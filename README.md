The data was retrieved from Kaggle, including various features on the physicochemical attributes on wine, and their rated quality as 'good' or 'bad'.
I clean the data, perform relevant feature engineering, and preprocess data for machine learning and analysis.
I use a variety of classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, KNN, and an ensemble model) to classify wines and compare their accuracy to make predictions.
